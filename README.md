## Contributing

Simply fork the repo, make changes, then open a **Pull Request** (of course, on Bitbucket! :))

**If you create a pull request on GitHub your pull request will be CLOSED without further or prior notice. This is because we don't pull from GitHub. If you wants to contribute, please go over Bitbucket repository and CREATE PULL REQUESTS THERE. Sorry for any inconvenience.**

## Mirror

We mirror our repository here for reference and views as well as bringing discussions here.

### FAQ

**Q: Why don't you just use GitHub?**

A: Issue tracking here is some kind of inconvenient. You can see any of [justalemon](https://github/justalemon)'s repository for example, and there is always a lot of tags. At there we can set integrated fields, including priority, affected version, fix version, and so without using a lot of tags.

**Q: Will it keep up to date?**

A: Yes. See that `push.sh` we create here? It is for pushing commits at real time.

**Q: Are discussions available?**

A: Yes!
